- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Doxrox , I am looking for a new way to earn a living while at the same time hopefully learning a new skillset.
I am available via email at austindoxtator@hotmail.com. I enjoy making new friends and having friendly interactions with new people, I am hoping someone
would be so kind as to show me the ropes and help me perform better in this community. 

I am a rather boring 22 year old looking to find new ways to help myself and my family.
So don't take this the wrong way when I am just essentially a "noobie" some might say when I want to learn how this community works and what it takes to learn 
different abilities that will allow me to be capable to earn a profit or in in otherwords a living.

My birthday is December 17th I'm a Sagittarius ‚ôê and love the snow but hate how cold it gets here in Canada. 
A little bit of a contradiction in itself but that's okay, as I'm still learning. I ask someone to please show me the ropes and not think of me as
a loser or anything of the sort. Just a young mind trying to learn new things and new ways to make money. I am friendly and look forward to hearing any responses. 
Preferably not rude, lol. Anyways take care and enjoy yourself.
